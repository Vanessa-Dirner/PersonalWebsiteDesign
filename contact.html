        <tr>
        <td>How did you end up in both fine arts and IT?</td>
        <td>I was interested in both from a young age. You could find me drawing, dancing, singing as well as building, experimenting with and destroying computers.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>I see some of the art says reproduction. What does that mean?</td>
        <td>As with any field, learning by copying masters is the best way to advance skills. This stretches the artist's mind to think in the way of someone else.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Are the graphic design examples for real company's?</td>
        <td>Yes, all of the graphic design was for real clients through my workplaces.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Tell me about the Project Plan?</td>
        <td>It was a collaborative work created for a scenario, which we presented as a powerpoint to our audience.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Do you have any other examples?</td>
        <td>Yes, I plan to put up more as time goes on, but if you have something specific you would like to see let me know.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>How did you learn all these skills?</td>
        <td>While I did learn a fair amount through school, I find on the job learning to be the most efficient way, along with experimenting on my own time.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>What do you mean by experimenting?</td>
        <td>I have my own home lab consisting of a server, multiple switches and more that I use to learn. I like to dabble in virtualization and legacy software.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>How do you learn all of this?</td>
        <td>I'm an avid reader, with an entire bookshelf on various topics in business and finance, operating systems like DOS, Oracle, Unix, Red Hat Linux and programming like Visual C, C, C++ Java, and Pl/SQL.</td>
